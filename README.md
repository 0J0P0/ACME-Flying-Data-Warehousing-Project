# Data Warehousing (Descriptive analytics)
## ACME-Flying

Given a concrete Use Case (i.e., ACME-Flying Use Case), the aim of this project is to design a Data Warehouse that allows to perform descriptive analysis (i.e., OLAP). The project consists of two tasks, that need to be submitted as two separate submissions and will be evaluated separately:

1. Design a multidimensional model (i.e., star schema) that complies with the requirements defined in the statement (see Section 1). In this step you will use the Indyco Builder software.
2. Develop an ETL process that allows to extract, transform and load the data from existing databases (i.e., AMOS and AIMS) to the schema developed in the first step. Here you will use the Talend Open Studio for Data Integration software.
